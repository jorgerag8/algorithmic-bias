Replication project about ProPublica's analysis of the COMPAS Recidivism Risk Scores. The main objective is to replicate the logistic regressional model used and evaluate the authors' results in and out-of-sample. Furthermore, I performed a revision of the model, comparing its predicted performance and comparing it with some competing models. These competing models can vary in assumptions and sets of covariates.
