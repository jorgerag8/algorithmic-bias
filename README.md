Replication project about ProPublica's analaysis of the COMPAS Recidivism Risk Scores. The main objective is to replicate the logistic 
regressional model used and evalute the authors' results in- and out-of-sample. Furthermore, I performed a revision of the model, comapring its
predicting performance and comparing in it with some competing models. These comepting models can vary in assumptions and sets of covariates.
